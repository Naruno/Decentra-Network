# Introduction

From the beginning of internet, all systems are designed as an client or server. With this the data security, authority and our futures are in the hands of a few.

From 2008 to today, the world has seen the rise of cryptocurrencies. These cryptocurrencies are the first step to a decentralized world. But they are not enough. We need a decentralized network that can be used by everyone.

This network should be realistic, stable and functional because futures are based on the present. So this network must be able to be used by everyone, everywhere and for everything.

This network is Naruno.

# Naruno

Naruno is a lightning-fast, secure, and scalable blockchain that is able to create transaction proofs and verification via raw data and timestamp. We remove the archive nodes and lazy web3 integrations. With Naruno everyone can get the proof (5-10MB) of their transactions via their nodes and after everyone can use in another node for verification the raw data and timestamp. Also you can integrate your web3 applications with 4 code lines (just python for now) via our remote app system.

We are present the real blockchain which based on the real princibles.

We are Fast, Secure, and Decentralized.

<br>

Naruno is written in **PEP8** format and **only** needs dependent libraries for GUI panel. Naruno that designed with a focus on the **community on the Github platform**, In addition, **Stability**, **Functional** and **Unit** tests of all systems are ready and automated. It also has various structures for **automatic setup of test environments**. It is fully compatible with **Git code management system** and **Agile mindset**.
