# Accessing to The API

In normal usage (api/main.py) the default host is 0.0.0.0 and port is 8000.

In auto_builders based instalation the host is 0.0.0.0 and port is
increase by node number. For example:

- 1st node port is 8000
- 2nd node port is 8101
- 3rd node port is 8102

# Starting the API

For starting the API you should run the api/main.py file. If you use the [Automatic Building a Test Network](https://docs.decentranetwork.net/building_a_test_network/automatic.html) you don't need to start API manually. The API will start automatically with the node.

Otherwise you can start the API with the following command:

```bash
python3 Decentra-Network/decentra_network/api/main.py
```

Also you can give the -p parameter for changing the port of the API. For example:

```bash
python3 Decentra-Network/decentra_network/api/main.py -p 8000
```

_If you use [Building a Test Network](https://docs.decentranetwork.net/building_a_test_network/) you should change "Decentra-Network" to ex. "Decentra-Network-0"._
