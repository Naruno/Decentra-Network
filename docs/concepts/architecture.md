# The Architecture

The Decentra Network is a decentralized network of nodes that run the Decentra Network software. The Decentra Network software is a different implementation for blockchain.

We are use three layers of the Decentra Network architecture:

## Layer 1: Decisions

We have a frontends and backend in this layer, the fronends are the CLI, API, and GUI. The backend is the circulation. This layer is responsible for making decisions.

## Layer 2: Processing

This layer is responsible for processing the decisions made in the Layer 1. We are controlling the concept system and we are continue to blockchain in this layer.
