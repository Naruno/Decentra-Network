# The Consensus
Consensus is one of the most important issues in decentralized networks, it allows everyone to agree without an administrator. Decentra Network uses a clean and fast consensus. All users comply with the rules of this consensus and as a result, they agree and create the block. Our consensus system is in FBA (Federated Byzantine Agreement) infrastructure

# Consensus Properties
Decentra Network's consensus has the following features.
* Every user in Decentra Network is private and can only be accessed by unl nodes
* All users can agree on the latest state, and which transactions have occurred in which order
* All valid transactions are processed without needing a central operator failure
* Decentra Network Blockchain can make progress even if some participants join, leave, or behave inappropriately
* If too many participants are unreachable or misbehaving, the network fails to make progress rather than diverging or confirming invalid transactions.
* Confirming transactions does not require wasteful or competitive use of resources, unlike most other blockchain systems.

# Rounds
Our consensus system is two-rounds. As a result of these rounds, the block is creaded and validated.
