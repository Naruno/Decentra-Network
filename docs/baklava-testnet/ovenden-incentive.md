# Baklava TestNet Ovenden Incentive

In Baklava we are introduce an incentive for testing our official applications and after all the Integration library. You can get your incentive with this document.


## Application 1: Address Ping System

### What is Address Ping System?
[Address Ping System](https://github.com/Naruno/Address-Ping-System) (APS) is a tool designed to check the online status of servers associated with blockchain addresses in Naruno. With APS, you can ensure that the servers you want to communicate with are online and reachable before sending any messages or making any transactions.

### Installation
You can install APS via this command:
```console
pip3 install address_ping_system
```

### Usage
You should send an ping to our official address to get your incentive:

* Please give an free port for APS. You can set this port via `--port` argument. If you dont set this argument APS will use 4444 port.

```console
aps --password YourWalletPass --port 4444 ping f687088eff5423f913f03b677f97a9c405f7549a
```

*Then wait for 5 minutes.
