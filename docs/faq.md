# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is Naruno?

Naruno is a blockchain network that is designed to be used by everyone, everywhere and for everything.

## What is the purpose of Naruno?

The purpose of Naruno is to provide a decentralized applications network for all scales.

## What is the difference between Naruno and other blockchain networks?

Naruno is have true decentralized apps integration structure. With this structure you can transfer your today applications to Naruno with minimum changes and IT costs.

## How did you do provide Scalability, Security and Decentralization?

We use the latest consensus mindset for entire of our system, and we use the our new techniques for scalability. So the consensus is provice the security and decentralization and the new techniques is provide the scalability.

## There is a master chain in Naruno?

No, for now there is no master chain in Naruno. But we are working for complating ALPHA version of Naruno, and in this version we will provide us a master chain.

## Wallet Security

We are ECDSA algorithm for our wallets, also we are develop a custom addressing system for wallets.

## Why not use a Smart Contract for Decentralized Apps?

Because smart contacts are not developed for developing decentralized applications. Smart contracts are developed for financial transactions. When you use a smart contract for your decentralized app you add a heavy layer to your app and to chain. Also every data is a transaction and every transaction is a fee. So you need to pay for every data. This is not good for decentralized apps in general. So we are propose a true solutions on our network.

## What is circulation?

Naruno is have a heart and when the heart is beating the circulation is start. Circulation is the process that runs consensus, and the consensus is process everyting in Naruno. Its basic and important process for Naruno. We use this method for high performance in slow hardwares.

## How can i learn Naruno?

Naruno have a professional structure, this structure can be light for developers. We recommend firstly you to read our documentation for learning Naruno. After you can dive into our code and you can learn our code. Also you can join our community and you can ask your questions.
